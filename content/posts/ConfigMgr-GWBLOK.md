I started with ConfigMgr in 2012 and it has changed my entire career path, and personal life.
I had no idea that starting to use this tool also meant I was joining the most amazing community of professionals.
The friends I've made and the skills I've learned because of this tool have been no small part of shaping the last decade of my life.

Thank you Microsoft Configuration Manager team and the community that makes this tool really great.
