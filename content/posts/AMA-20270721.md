We release ConfigMgr three times a year and with each release there is at least a page of features.  If you're seeing feature dumps every four months it's safe to say that the product is not on the path deprecation.

We used to put up at our conferences we put up big banners that say SCCM is not dead and then we started putting up big banners and say Configuration Manager is not dead and yet we still continually get ... from our customers all the time "when do I have to go to Intune because I know Configuration Manager is on a path to deprecation", can you please, I don't want to say for once and for all because we're going to continually drive this home, can you like just verify the fact that Configuration Manager is not dead and we still continue to develop for it.

I can offer some guidance, just to the generic Microsoft customer about assumptions... if anybody has looked at the ConfigMgr roadmap that is available you start
looking at the fact that we release ConfigMgr three times a year and with each release there is at least a page of features that come with each release.  If you're seeing feature dumps every four months it's safe to say that the product is not on the path deprecation.
When should you worry about the product being on the path to deprecation?  When you stop seeing new features being developed.  I would give that guidance to anybody out there using or consuming any Microsoft product.  For ConfigMgr again, I'll defer to Danny who is the authority there.

I feel like I get this question once a week if not sometimes a day. ConfigMgr is not dead.  It's not on a deprecation path.
